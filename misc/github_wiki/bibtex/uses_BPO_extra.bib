abstract = {Mechanistic models of single-neuron dynamics have been extensively studied in computational neuroscience. However, identifying which models can quantitatively reproduce empirically measured data has been challenging. We propose to overcome this limitation by using likelihood-free inference approaches (also known as Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC) to perform full Bayesian inference on single-neuron models. Our approach builds on recent advances in ABC by learning a neural network which maps features of the observed data to the posterior distribution over parameters. We learn a Bayesian mixture-density network approximating the posterior over multiple rounds of adaptively chosen simulations. Furthermore, we propose an efficient approach for handling missing features and parameter settings for which the simulator fails, as well as a strategy for automatically learning relevant features using recurrent neural networks. On synthetic data, our approach efficiently estimates posterior distributions and recovers ground-truth parameters. On in-vitro recordings of membrane voltages, we recover multivariate posteriors over biophysical parameters, which yield model-predicted voltage traces that accurately match empirical data. Our approach will enable neuroscientists to perform Bayesian inference on complex neuron models without having to design model-specific algorithms, closing the gap between mechanistic and statistical approaches to single-neuron modelling.},

  abstract = {Identifying the cell types constituting brain circuits is a fundamental question in neuroscience and motivates the generation of taxonomies based on electrophysiological, morphological and molecular single cell properties. Establishing the correspondence across data modalities and understanding the underlying principles has proven challenging. Bio-realistic computational models offer the ability to probe cause-and-effect and have historically been used to explore phenomena at the single-neuron level. Here we introduce a computational optimization workflow used for the generation and evaluation of more than 130 million single neuron models with active conductances. These models were based on 230 in vitro electrophysiological experiments followed by morphological reconstruction from the mouse visual cortex. We show that distinct ion channel conductance vectors exist that distinguish between major cortical classes with passive and h-channel conductances emerging as particularly important for classification. Next, using models of genetically defined classes, we show that differences in specific conductances predicted from the models reflect differences in gene expression in excitatory and inhibitory cell types as experimentally validated by single-cell RNA-sequencing. The differences in these conductances, in turn, explain many of the electrophysiological differences observed between cell types. Finally, we show the robustness of the herein generated single-cell models as representations and realizations of specific cell types in face of biological variability and optimization complexity. Our computational effort generated models that reconcile major single-cell data modalities that define cell types allowing for causal relationships to be examined.},

abstract = {Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. It represents one of the greatest medical challenges as no pharmacologic treatments are available to prevent disease progression. Astrocytes play crucial functions within neuronal circuits by providing metabolic and functional support, regulating interstitial solute composition, and modulating synaptic transmission. In addition to these physiological functions, growing evidence points to an essential role of astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Early-stage AD is associated with hypometabolism and oxidative stress. Contrary to neurons that are vulnerable to oxidative stress, astrocytes are particularly resistant to mitochondrial dysfunction and are therefore more resilient cells. In our study, we leveraged astrocytic mitochondrial uncoupling and examined neuronal function in the 3xTg AD mouse model. We overexpressed the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 4 (UCP4), which has been shown to improve neuronal survival in vitro. We found that this treatment efficiently prevented alterations of hippocampal metabolite levels observed in AD mice, along with hippocampal atrophy and reduction of basal dendrite arborization of subicular neurons. This approach also averted aberrant neuronal excitability observed in AD subicular neurons and preserved episodic-like memory in AD mice assessed in a spatial recognition task. These findings show that targeting astrocytes and their mitochondria is an effective strategy to prevent the decline of neurons facing AD-related stress at the early stages of the disease.},
